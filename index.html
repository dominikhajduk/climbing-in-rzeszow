            </h3>

            <p>Technical University offers two climbing walls. Climbing walls have a dedicated <a
                    href="http://sciana.prz.rzeszow.pl/english.php">website</a>, where the main <a
                    href="http://sciana.prz.rzeszow.pl/english.php">info is presented in English</a>. The climbing
                walls you can find on <a href="http://sciana.prz.rzeszow.pl/jak_dojechac.php">Google Maps</a>. Walls are
                open from October to June. During summer Holidays walls are generally closed. Exact days and hours are
                marked on the schedule. If the schedule is empty, walls are probably closed. Technical University offers
                two walls: small and big one. Small wall offers mostly top rope and lead climbing with rope but you can
                find also some place for bouldering. Big wall offers top rope, lead climbing and speed wall. Some wall
                related news (in PL) are presented on <a href="https://twitter.com/scianaprz">Twitter</a>. If you didn't
                climb before consider <a href="http://cruxwall.pl/kontakt">climbing course</a> as on the wall we assume
                that you climb before and you can belay. </p>

                FlyWall climbing centre
            </h3>
            <p>
                Flywall is the biggest climbing centre in Rzeszów. It offers traditional rope climbing and boulder wall.
                There are around 530 square meters of a big wall for rope climbing (both top rope and lead climbing).
                Wall is 11,5m high. Some lines offer automatic belaying machines (so you can be an asshole without partner
                and keep climbing ;) ). Boulder wall offers 230 square meters for climbing. There is also a fun climbing wall for
                kids and rope courses. The climbing wall offers courses, classes with an instructor and sections. Wall is placed 
                on <a href="https://g.page/FlyWall?share">Siemieńskiego 14 street</a>. More details you can find on <a

            <p>Peron Baltoro climbing centre is the biggest boulder wall in Rzeszów. Here you can find <a
                    href="http://rkw.org.pl/peron_baltoro/">wall website</a>. The place can be found near Rzeszów main
                train station (<a href="https://g.page/Peron_Baltoro?share">Google Maps link</a>). The location itself
                is also a source of the name - "peron" in Polish means "train platform" and "Baltoro" is taken from
                previous climbing centre wall name. Unfortunately, there is no English version of the website and it is
                not always up to date, so you should look for more details on
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peronbaltoro.rzeszow/">Facebook</a>. Peron Baltoro offers great
                bouldering possibilities and a lot of training accessories like Bachar ladder, campus or system wall.
                The climbing centre belongs to Rzeszów Mountaineering Club. Probably the most climatic place to climb in
                Rzeszów.</p>

                The schedule is not published and you should probably ask using Facebook. Wall is generally vertical (no
                overhang) and offers rope climbing. Climbing wall on <a
